	\section{Introdution}
	
	Jets  -  A paragraph on what jets are, how they are formed, hadronisation of free quark due to quark confinement. 
   
	\hspace{1 mm}
	 - A small bit on why they are interesting, studies that have used them. 
	\newline	\newline		
	Jet Algorithms - Why we need them?

	- Jets appear as clusters in the calorimeter, from that using algorithms we want to reconstruct the jet and find its properties.
	\newline \newline
	Current Jet Algorithms - CA/AKT/KT as defined in the TASI lectures or in towards jetography.

					    - They are used at ATLAS/CMS
	\newline \newline
	SC Jet Algorithm - Define it as in Tseng, Evans \cite{Tseng}

	- Discuss Motivations for it.

	- Discuss Pruning Effect.
