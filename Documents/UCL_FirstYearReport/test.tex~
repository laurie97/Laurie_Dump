         Something to do with b-tagging, I presume. I will write this after its all written, I think this is the best way of doing an abstract! 
         Filling in some space now so I can see what it looks like.

\section{Introduction}

In high energy proton collisions, narrow beams of propagating high energy hadrons, known as  jets,  are produced by an interaction that 
contains free quarks or gluons in its final state. Flavour tagging is the 
identification of \textit{b}-jets, \textit{c}-jets and light-flavoured jets, which are defined as jets containing a \textit{b}-hadrons, 
charmed-hadrons and only light hadrons (only containing \textit{u},\textit{d} and \textit{s} quarks) respectively.
Flavour tagging is achieved by utilising the large lifetimes of the \textit{b}-hadrons and charmed-hadrons 
(of the order 1.5 ps and 0.4-1 ps respectively), due to the fact that they can only decay through the flavour changing weak interaction. 
The large lifetimes of  the heavy flavour hadrons means that the they will decay a measurable distance from the 
primary vertex, the point where the hard-scatter collision occurs, and hence the flavour can be infered from the prescence of particles 
that originate from a point offset from the primary vertex. \newline

Flavour tagging of \textit{b}-quarks (b-tagging) is important for many analyses, as the \textit{b}-quark is the 2nd most massive quark in the 
standard model ($m_{b} \sim 5 \text{ GeV}$) and as a third generation quark, partners the most massive quark, the top quark. 
Two analyses where these properties mean that b-tagging features strongly are $t\bar{t}$ analyses and searches for a Higgs boson decaying to $b\bar{b}$.
In the former, as the top decays to a \textit{W}-boson and a \textit{b}-quark with a branching ratio of close to 100\%, $t\bar{t}$ typically require a b-tagged jet. 
In the latter, the Higgs boson coupling in proportional to mass squared, hence the large mass of the \textit{b}-quark means that $H\to b\bar{b}$ is 
the decay of the Higgs boson with the largest branching-ratio (the top quark's mass is too large for a Higgs boson to decay into $t\bar{t}$), 
which means that it is the best channel to make the first observation of the Higgs boson coupling to fermions. b-tagging is also important for a number of 
exotic and super-symmetry searches due to the properties of the \textit{b}-quark mentioned above. \newline

\subsection{Flavour Tagging Algorithms}

There are three main base flavour tagging algorithms used at ATLAS, each of which utilise the extended lifetimes of the heavy hadrons by searching for tracks,
reconstructed in the inner detector, that show that there are particles coming from a decay offset from the primary vertex.
Then the three base algorithms are then combined to create a multivariate tagger, which has the most optimal flavour-tagging peformance.

\subsubsection{Impact Parameter Based: IP3D}

The IP3D algorithm is an impact parameter based flavour tagging tool. 
In this algoritm, for all tracks associated to a jet, the distance of closest approach, known as the impact parameter, is calculated in both the transverse 
(perpindicular to beam-pipe) and longitudinal(parallel to beam-pipe) direction, which are labelled as $d_{0}$ and $z_{0}$.
Then the algorithm calculates a likelihood of the jet having a specific flavour, 
based on the distributions of the impact paremeters ($d_{0}$, $z_{0}$), and the distributions of their significances 
($d_{0}/ \sigma _{d0}$ and  $z_{0}/\sigma_{z0}$) of tracks inside the jet.

\subsubsection{Secondary Vertex: SV1}

The SV1 algorithm aims to reconstruct a secondary vertex of two or more intersecting tracks, corrosponding to the decay of a heavy-flavour hadron. 
Properties of the reconstructed secondary vertex that show flavour discrimination are, for example; vertex 
invariant mass and energy fraction (fraction of jet energy contained in the secondary vertex) which will be large for 
\textit{b}-jets due to the heavy mass of the \texit{b}-hadron, the distance in the transverse plane between the 
primary vertex and the secondary vertex (2D fligh path L_{XY}), which will be large for \textit{b}-jets
due to the long lifetime of the \texit{b}-hadron and the number of tracks at the secondary vertex, which will be large for
well constructed secondary vertices, which are more likely in \textit{b}-jets.
